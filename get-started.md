# Get Started

While you can write complete Fabulous applications, Fabulous can not be used independently as it does not provide any UI rendering by itself.

You'll need to choose a "flavor" of Fabulous first from the list:

* Fabulous for [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms)
* Fabulous for [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui)
* Fabulous for [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net)

The flavor you choose will determine the requirements, the available widgets and the supported platforms you can target.

Once chosen, please refer to the corresponding "Get Started" documentation to learn more about writing an app with that flavor.
