# Welcome

Fabulous is a modern declarative UI framework for crafting cross-platform mobile and desktop apps in .NET. It aims to bring you a great development experience and confidence in your code by combining an expressive UI syntax, the simple & robust Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture, and functional programming.

### About Fabulous&#x20;

Fabulous aims to provide all the tools to let you create your own mobile and desktop apps using only F# and the [Model-View-Update architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) (shorten to MVU), with a great F# DSL for building dynamic UIs.\
The combination of F# and MVU makes for a great development experience.

Note that Fabulous itself does not provide UI controls, so youâ€™ll need to combine it with another framework like Xamarin.Forms, .NET MAUI or AvaloniaUI.
